R and Python scripts to scrape stats.nba.com for score differentials at every second. R does the scraping and Python is used for the final calculation and for input into a MySQL database.

The idea behind the WMOV statistic is that by only recording the score differential at the end of the 48th minute, we are losing a lot of information about how a game progresses in minutes 1-47. Of course, that final score is ultimately what matters to teams and fans, but it will be interesting to see the differences between how a team typically does throughout a game and how a team fares at the end of the game.

CASE: The Golden State Warriors had a dominant season by every measure, accruing a 67-15 record with a 10.1 average margin of victory en route to a championship. Only 8 teams have maintained a double digit point differential over the course of an entire season. All of them won championships. The Warriors WMOV score was a league leading 5.8 points. This means that at an average second of any game, the Warriors were nearly two full possessions ahead of their opponent. While reaffirming their dominance, WMOV also reveals that the Warriors had the greatest difference between their final margin of victory and their average lead (WMOV). While a double digit Warriors win could be expected, that double digit lead may not come until close to the end of the game.
